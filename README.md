This is a simple Python script that checks the strength of a password and returns whether it is weak, medium, strong, or invalid.

## Getting Started

To use this script, simply download the password_strength_checker.py file and run it using Python 3. You can also use the test_passwords.txt file to test the script against a list of sample passwords.

### Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your computer.

### Usage
