# Password Strength Checker (PyPassStrength)

This is a simple Python script that checks the strength of a password and returns whether it is weak, medium, strong, or invalid.

## Getting Started

To use this script, simply download the password_strength_checker.py file and run it using Python 3. You can also use the test_passwords.txt file to test the script against a list of sample passwords.

### Prerequisites
This script requires Python 3 to be installed on your computer.

### Usage
To use the script, simply run the password_strength_checker.py file using Python 3 and enter a password when prompted. The script will evaluate the strength of the password and output a message indicating whether it is weak, medium, strong, or invalid.

You can also test the script against a list of sample passwords by creating a test_passwords.txt file containing one password per line, and running the test_password_strength.py file using Python 3.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the script:

'''
$ python password_strength_checker.py
Enter a password: password
Your password is weak.

$ python password_strength_checker.py
Enter a password: P@ssword123
Your password is medium.

$ python password_strength_checker.py
Enter a password: MyP@ssw0rd!sV3ryStr0ng
Your password is strong.
